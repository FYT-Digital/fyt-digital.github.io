We recognized a need to prolong the usage of electronic devices particularly wearables and IoT devices. We are developing a unique collection of <b> ultra-low power digital cell libraries </b> for microchip design, and we believe that this will <b> increase battery lifetime by 2X </b> and <b> reduce electricity cost by 10X </b> (subject to electricity tariff).
</p>

<p align="justify">
On top of this, we are developing a <b> library recommendation tool </b> to help chip architects to evaluate suitable cell libraries during the chip design process. This will facilitate microchip designers to <b> reduce time to design chips by 300X </b> and roll out ASIC products faster.

We are a start-up from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). With more than 20 years of combined experience in the field, we understand the needs for the development and production of the ultra-low power integrated circuit market segment. We have over a decade of experience developing digital cell library IPs and ASIC design.
