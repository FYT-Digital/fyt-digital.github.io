# WHO ARE WE?
We are a start-up from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). 
We are a team of professionals that understand the needs for the development and production of the ultralow-power integrated circuit market segment. 
We have over a decade of experience developing digital cell library IPs and front-end IC design. 


# OUR SOLUTIONS

## Digital Cell Library as a Service (DiCLaaS) for SoC Design
We recognized a need to prolong the usage of electronic devices like wearables and IoT devices. 
We are developing a collection of ultra-low power digital cell libraries for microchip design, and we believe that this will increase battery lifetime by 2X and reduce electricity cost by 10X.

On top of this, we are developing a library recommendation tool to help chip architects to evaluate suitable cell libraries during the chip design process. 
This will facilitate microchip designers to reduce time to design chips by 300X and roll out products faster.

# CURRENT STATUS
Currently, we are in the process of market validation.
We are looking for a strategic relationship with potential clients from fabless design houses and foundries and funding from VCs or government agencies to facilitate us scaling up our solutions.
